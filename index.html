                <p>The Austrian School is a heterodox school of economic thought that is

                      phenomena result exclusively from the motivations and actions
                       of individuals.

            <p class="quote">Socialism, like the ancient ideas from which it springs,
                 confuses the distinction between government and society. As a result 
                 of this, every time we object to a thing being done by government, 
                 the socialists conclude that we object to its being done at all . . 
                 . . It is as if the socialists were to accuse us of not wanting persons 
                 to eat because we do not want the state to raise grain</blockquote>
